## probes
This directory contains the synthesized probe designs. `FMN_131001_RG_3901.fa` is the full baitset; `FMN_131001_RG_3901_phylogeneticlocionly.fa` concerns only the phylogenetic loci. Phylogenetic locus names may be distinguished by referencing Arabidopsis genes; functional loci reference Medicago genes.

## phylogenetic_locus_design
This directory contains files relevant to the phylogenetic locus design. `1kp_rosids.xlsx` contains information concerning input transcriptome data from the 1KP project used for marker design. `individual_20taxa_sequences_probedesign_mybaitsformat.fasta` contains the sequences directly used for probe design.

## phylogenetic_locus_reference
This directory contains reference files used for assembly (not design). `Consensus sequences_main_50percentambiguities_juglanstrimmed.fasta` is a DNA reference comprising a consensus file based on DNA alignments. `phylogenetic_loci_arabidopsis_proteins.fasta` is a protein reference comprising Arabidopsis orthologs of included loci.

## functional_locus_design
This directory contains files relevant to functional locus design. `candidates_medicago_malus_populus_cucumis.withpromoters.fasta` contains DNA sequences directly used for probe design.

## functional_locus_reference
This directory contains reference files used for assembly (not design). `ALL_candidates_50percentconsensus.fasta` is a DNA reference comprising a consensus file based on DNA alignments. `candidate_gene_proteins.fasta` is a protein reference comprising Medicago orthologs of included loci. `all_candidates_medicago.fasta` is a DNA reference comprising Medicago orthologs of included loci.
